This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Firebase SDK in Kotlin, specifically the issue of improper initialization in background threads. The code in 'Bug.kt' showcases a scenario where Firebase functions are called before proper initialization within a background thread, leading to unexpected errors and application crashes. The solution provided in 'Solution.kt' corrects the issue using proper context and ensures Firebase services work correctly even in asynchronous operations.
